# Programming Diary

**Programming Diary** is a self-hosted Angular application which keeps track of my repositories part of *[#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)*. It also works as the Log needed in this challenge and can be replaced instead of the suggested *Markdown Log*, rendering a timeline as you write on it. You can [check my progress out here](https://github.com/rasouza/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).

**Programming Diary** works together with its [backend API](https://github.com/rasouza/diary-api-php).
