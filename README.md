# Programming Diary

![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/9pkLmA9.png "Programming Diary")

**Programming Diary** is a self-hosted Angular application which keeps track of my repositories that are part of my *[#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)*. It also works as a Log needed in this challenge which can be substituted over the *Markdown Log*, rendering a timeline as you write on it.
